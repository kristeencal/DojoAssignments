Python's range() Parameters

The range() function has two sets of parameters, as follows:

range(stop)

stop: Number of integers (whole numbers) to generate, starting from zero. eg. range(3) == [0, 1, 2].
range([start], stop[, step])

start: Starting number of the sequence.
stop: Generate numbers up to, but not including this number.
step: Difference between each number in the sequence.
Note that:

All parameters must be integers.
All parameters can be positive or negative.
range() (and Python in general) is 0-index based, meaning list indexes start at 0, not 1. eg. The syntax to access the first element of a list is mylist[0]. Therefore the last integer generated by range() is up to, but not including, stop. For example range(0, 5) generates integers from 0 up to, but not including, 5.
